The function "check" is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm 
if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. 

The sensor provided for the exercise fakes the behaviour of a 
real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values.

Write a unit test for the check function. Initially, do not change
the code for Alarm or Sensor. When you have an initial test in 
place, (or have given up!) review your test code together with the 
session facilitator.

When the facilitator says you can, refactor the code to make it testable. 
Take care not to alter the functionality, or change interfaces which 
other client code may rely on. Add more tests to cover the functionality 
of the Alarm class.
